Calculator

This is a basic calculator that supports the four common operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with the ability to clear the calculator if needed. 

Technology Used:
This project uses HTML and CSS to design the webpage and uses Javascript to handle all of the logic behind the scenes.

Challenges:
Some of the main challenges with this project were coming up with a way to seamlessly get two seperate inputs that could then be operated on and figuring out when the calculator should reset the screen for a new input or append numbers to the screen for a multi-digit number.
